# VendingMachine

Backend Logic for a Vending Machine

## To Run
Setup .env file with DB_NAME & DB_CONN_STRING. 
Can be started with docker configuration. For running locally I am using MongoDB Atlas
by providing the URL as DB_CONN_STRING which simplifies the setup a lot.

If provided with a proper .env file with db name and db url the application
can be started using the commands in package.json.

Below is a POSTMAN collection. Additionally, there are also some basic tests
